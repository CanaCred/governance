The Canadian Credential Network (Canacred) is a team of volunteers who believe that a Canadian Network Utility will best serve Canadian citizens, businesses, government and academic institutions. Until a global trusted network can be put together, we need to launch a Canadian-focused network as the most secure and equitable way to move forward.

The members of the Canacred represent a group of volunteers striving to create and promote hosted-in-Canada Utility.  The Canacred serves the purpose of raising, budgeting and spending funds in support of the Utility and the Canacred Wallet, which will be tasked with providing Canadians with user-friendly, secure and trustworthy digital credentials wallet.

The Canacred is intended to serve organizations that desire to participate in [digital trust ecosystems](./gf_info/glossary.md) and require an governance framework that will strive to follow principles of SSI and and leverage guiding principles introduced by Pan-Canadian Trust Framework:

* Support robust, secure, scalable solutions
* Implement, protect, and enhance privacy by design
* Be inclusive, open, and meet broad stakeholder needs
* Provide Canadians with choice, control, and convenience
* Build on open standards-based protocols
* Minimize data transfer between sources and avoid creation of new or expanded identity information repositories
* Be transparent in governance and operation

To meet these requirements, the Canacred Utility operates pursuant to its own governance framework. Network members pay annual membership fees and provide supporting infrastructure to maintain a sustainable permissioned identity utility that is structured as an enterprise safe-space and purpose built for trusted ecosystem for verified credentials. The Network leverages an independent [Utility Service Provider](./gf_info/glossary.md) as a fee-based administrator for the delivery of a [DID Ledger](./gf_info/glossary.md) associated with a unique DID Root Namespace, ```did:ccn```.
// TODO: Do we need to establish our own DID method?

The governing body responsible for the CCNU-GF is the *Governing Board*.
