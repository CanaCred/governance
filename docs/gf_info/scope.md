## Scope

This is an inventory of the stakeholders, assets/artifacts and objectives for which the GF is intended to provide governance. It:

1. SHOULD clearly state the stakeholders in the Trust Community.
1. SHOULD clearly state the high-level assets/artifacts (e.g. verifiable credentials, transactions, records) under oversight by the GF.
1. SHOULD clearly state the high-level GF objectives (i.e the desired result when the GF achieves its purpose).
1. SHOULD, if applicable, clearly state who and what are out of scope.
