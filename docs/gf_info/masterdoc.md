## Introduction
<!--> Will we using guidance from the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group for our GF? -->
The purpose of the Canadian Credential Network is to provide a decentralized public utility for trusted relationship in Canada.
The Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework (the "CCN-GF") serves as the *constitution* for the *Canadian Credential Network*. It represents an instance of a [ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/governance-stack/) under the guidance of the [ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/utility-foundry/).

The CCN-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital relationship based on decentralized identity.

A key objective of the CCN-GF is to address any concerns or risks that Network members may have as participants. For example, compliance with Data Protection Regulations such as the Canada's Privacy Act and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).

The purpose of the Canadian Credential Network is to administer decentralized governance for Canadian Credential Network.

## Governance Framework

### Governance Documents
The CCN-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents that collectively form the governance model for the that the Network manages. The documents are organized in three (3) categories; Rose = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative.

### Core Principles
See [CCN Principles](./principles.md).

## Core Polices
In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design and Security by Design principles:

1. Policies, practices, procedures, and algorithms governing participation of [Stewards](./glossary.md) and operation of Nodes MUST follow all Core Principles.
2. The Network MUST publish the following Controlled Documents managed as specified by CCN Governing Bodies:​
a. Member Business Policies
b. Member Technical Policies​
c. Ledger Access Policies
​
### Inclusion
In keeping with the Inclusive by Design principles but in recognition of the permissioned write structure of the Canadian Credential Network Utility:
<!--We need to create "Utility Agreement-->
1. Read access to the Canadian Credential Network Utility MUST be open to all types of entities.  
2. Write access will be limited to members and non-members in good standing within the Network.
3. Write access will be limited to members and non-members that have signed the necessary ```Utility Agreements```. See ```Exibit B``` of the Participation Agreement.

### Trust Assurance
In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design principles:

1. The Network MUST specify policies, practices, and procedures for assessing conformance to the Canacred Governance Framework by publishing and maintaining the Canacred Trust Assurance Framework​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by CCN Governing Bodies​. The Controlled Documents may leverage resources and guidance from the ToIP Foundation.
2. The Canadian Credential Network MUST publish a Canacred Trust Mark Policies​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by CCN Governing Bodies.​

## Economics
<!--I don't know if we need these currently. This might be described in the incorporation part for the Non-profit-->

In keeping with the Sustainability principle:

1. The Network  MAY publish the Canacred Economic Policies​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by CCN Governing Bodies​ in conjunction with Network legal counsel.
2. The Network MAY manage Ledger Fees and any mechanism used for paying them to ensure economic viability and sustainability for the Network to keep with its charter as a non-profit public trust organization.
3. The Network SHOULD retain a qualified Auditor to publish an annual public audit of Network finances.
<!--We need to create a list of Controlled Document as 'Appendix A'-->
## Governance
The Canacred Governance Framework Master Document and the Controlled Documents listed in ```Appendix A``` shall be revised from time to time. The policies in this section govern this process and procedures for managing document lifecycles.
<!--Governing Bodies will be those that are mentioned in the Incorporation part. Incorporation documents should be an Appendix for the GF-->
### General
1. The Network MUST publish CCN Governance Bodies as a Controlled Document managed by the Board of Directors.
2. CCN Governance Bodies MUST specify the Canadian Credential Network Governing Body for each Controlled Document.
3. All CCN-GF documents, including Controlled Documents, MUST use keywords in policies as defined in [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
<!-->
4. All CCN-GF documents MAY be revised to add non-normative
content, such as references to appendices, white papers, or other explanatory materials, without triggering a formal revision review process as defined in this ```Governance Section```.-->

### Source Control
All CCN-GF documents will reside in a [Github source control repository](https://github.com/CanaCred/governance/) and will use the associated [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CanaCred/governance/issues/) for change management.

### Approved Framework Process
1. Stable versions of the CCN-GF must be approved by the Board of Directors.
2. Approved versions need to be specified in the ```Version Control``` section of this document.
3. A static PDF file associated with the approved version MUST be stored in the ```/pdf/approved``` folder of the GitHub repo.
4. ```Appendix A``` of this document must be updated to point to the newly approved PDF file.

### Master Document Revisions
These policies apply to any normative revision to the present document, exclusive of ```Appendix A```.
1. Revisions to the CCN-GF Master Document MUST respect the Purpose and Core Principles.
2. The commencement of any revision process MUST be publicly announced by the Network no later than the time of commencement.
3. Decisions in the revision process is restricted to the Governing Board and SHOULD consider input from all CCN members.
4. Proposed revisions MUST be publicly announced by the Network.
<!--Check with Dave about next section 5-->
5. Revisions MUST be approved by a supermajority vote of at least two-thirds of the Governing Board and before the revision takes effect.

### Controlled Document Revisions
These policies apply to any normative revision to the Controlled Documents listed in ```Appendix A```.
1. The list of Controlled Documents in Appendix A, as well as each Controlled Document on that list, MAY be revised independently from the CCN-GF Master Document (the present document).
2. A Controlled Document MUST be stored in and use the source control mechanisms established in this ```Governance Section```.
4. Revisions to a Controlled Document MUST be approved by the Governing Board before the revision takes effect.

## Appendix A: Controlled Documents
The following Controlled Documents are normative components of the CCN-GF. All framework content is published by the Network in three forms:

1. A static PDF document representing the entire governance framework in a single document.
    * Latest compilation of material from the GitHub Repo (to be published later)
    * Official Governing Board Approved Version(to be published later)
2. A sub-section of the [CCN website](https://canacred.github.io/governance/) so that all documentation is easily navigated.  
3. Independent markdown files (```.md```) in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CanaCred/governance).
