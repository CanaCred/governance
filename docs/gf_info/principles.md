## Core Principles

Unless otherwise noted, the CCN-GF is aligned with the principles outlined in ```Principles of SSI``` of the [Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GhcLeZEujX9h5gqrFNP-C1dMrS71EdCY4Uc1hGQbqI0/edit).  
**December 2020**: CCN-GF leverage guiding principles introduced by [PCTF](https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PCTF-Model-Final-Recommendation_V1.0.pdf)

**Privacy by Design Principles**

1. **Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial**
   The Privacy by Design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. PbD does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred − it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, Privacy by Design comes before-the-fact, not after.

2. **Privacy as the Default Setting** 
   We can all be certain of one thing − the default rules! Privacy by Design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy − it is built into the system, by default.

3. **Privacy Embedded into Design**
   Privacy by Design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems and business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system, without diminishing functionality.

4. **Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum**
   Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretence of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, demonstrating that it is possible, and far more desirable, to have both.

5. **End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection**
   Privacy by Design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, Privacy by Design ensures cradle to grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.

6. **Visibility and Transparency – Keep it Open**
   Privacy by Design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its  component  parts  and  operations  remain  visible  and  transparent,  to  both  users  and  providers  alike. Remember, trust but verify!

7. **Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric**
   Above all, Privacy by Design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by  offering  such  measures  as  strong  privacy  defaults,  appropriate  notice,  and  empowering  user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric!

**Anti-oppressive Practices**
Work on better definition: 
>  Anti-oppressive practice is by and large understood to be an omnibus term that includes, but is not limited to, diverse practice approaches like feminist, anti-racist, critical, radical, and structural frameworks. Anti-oppressive social work stands as such for a variety of theories and practices that adopt the perspective of social justice. It should thus more appropriately be considered to be a perspective or stance toward practice rather than a practice approach.
