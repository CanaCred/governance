## Purpose

The Canadian Credential Network (CanaCred) is a volunteer and not-for-profit effort to build a regional Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) network for Canada.  Their opinion is that a Canadian network will best serve Canadian citizens, businesses, government and academic institutions.  Identity is fundamental to all internet transactions as well as daily personal interactions.  Until such a time as a trusted global effort can be put together, a Canadian-focused network is the most secure and equitable way to handle this.
Canacred is created to enable an ecosystem where the control of the digital identities lies in hands of consumers.
Canacred is created to focus on privacy of digital identities and personal information.
Canacred is created to support anti-oppresive practices.
