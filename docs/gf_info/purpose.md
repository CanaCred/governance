## Purpose

The Canadian Credential Network (CanaCred) is a volunteer and not-for-profit effort to build a regional Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) network for Canada.  Their opinion is that a Canadian network will best serve Canadian citizens, businesses, government and academic institutions.  Identity is fundamental to all internet transactions as well as daily personal interactions.  Until such a time as a trusted global effort can be put together, a Canadian-focused network is the most secure and equitable way to handle this.
